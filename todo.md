Graphics / Effects
==================
- [General] Jadir images.
- [General] Jadir resource bars.
- [Talent] Plate of Genesis: Special image for the artifact?
- [Talent] Silicine Slicers: Image for the trap.
- [Talent] Primordial Stone: Maybe have its own set of wall images?

Mechanics
=========
- [Talent] Resonating Stone: Figure out what negative effects to use, and then add them.

- [Talent] Sandstorm: Have it slow down projectiles.
- [General] Prevent Elementals from learning Combat Training.
- [Talent] Smoldering Core: Change scaling midpoint to 50% for both bonuses.
- [Talent] Rock Shell: Should only reduce incoming physical/magical crit rate instead of all. This might end up being too hard to do.
- [Talent] Architect's Wrath: Should hit things along the movement path of the walls as well.
- [Talent] Living Mural: See if it still needs to be deactivated on level change, and if not, keep it on.
- [Talent] Amorphous: Prevent it from teleporting you between two disjoint dust clouds.
