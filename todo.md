Stuff to be Added Later
=======================
- The other 3 races.
- The 3 trees all elementals can learn.

Graphics / Effects
==================
- [General] Jadir images.
- [General] Jadir resource bars.
- [Talent] Plate of Genesis: Special image for the artifact?
- [Talent] Silicine Slicers: Image for the trap.
- [Talent] Primordial Stone: Maybe have its own set of wall images?
- [Talent] Detonation: Make it use the earth beam particles in the explosion.
- [General] More sounds? I think I ended up using the 'earth' sound like 10 times...

Mechanics
=========
- [Talent] Brutish Stride: Make it charge faster if no enemies are in sight.
- [Talent] Sandstorm: Have it slow down projectiles.
- [General] Prevent Elementals from learning Combat Training (in ID).
- [Talent] Architect's Wrath: Should hit things along the movement path of the walls as well.
- [Talent] Amorphous: Prevent it from teleporting you between two disjoint dust clouds.
- [Talent] Cry of Eyal: Disable when you run out of max life.
- [General] Make temporary terrain not teleport drops.

Considerations
==============
- Jadir still need accuracy, maybe. Put a stacking defense debuff on sandstorm?
- Should Afterechoes work if you only have a shield equipped?
